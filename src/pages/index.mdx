# Notes on Go

## Syntax

This is where I will write some stuff about syntax

## The following is syntax highlighting:

```go:src/main.go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	fmt.Println("Whatever")
}
```

So this is where I can write some more.

And some more here.

And here is some more text.

**Testing**
